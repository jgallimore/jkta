    /**
     * Scan the list of jars for usage of javax and jakarta namespaces, generate a
     * compressed tsv and and stream the results into the specified Amazon S3 bucket.
     *
     * SCAN
     *
     * Jar paths are read from STDIN and resolved relative to the local repository
     * identified by the --repository flag.  All archives that exist and match the
     * --include and --exclude pattern are scanned for references to the affected
     * `javax` and `jakarta` namespaces.
     *
     * It's very important the paths passed to this command consist of the full
     * groupId, artifactId and version.  Either of the following two methods
     * will work to ensure the paths can be properly resolved:
     *
     *   - Change to the root of the maven repository before executing the
     *     command, ensuring `$PWD` evaluates to the base of the repository itself.
     *   - Use the --repository option to specify the location of the repository
     *     on the system.
     *
     * STREAM
     *
     * At the start of a scan an entry is made in the Amazon S3 bucket identified
     * via the --region and --bucket options.
     *
     * During the scan the tsv results are streamed directly into the S3 entry
     * without any buffering on the the disk.  This allows a scan to run several
     * hours or days without concerns of either running out of disk or losing
     * hours of work.  Roughly 5MB is buffered in memory at a time before being
     * flushed to the S3 entry, thus several dozen or hundreds of scan processes
     * can be run on the same machine without memory concerns.
     *
     * The entry name of the scan is both date-stamped and includes a random suffix
     * to avoid collisions when doing parallel processing.  For example a scan at
     * May 7, 2020 4:11 PM:
     *
     *      scan-2020_05_07_16_11-a6f0usy-0.4.tsv.gz
     *
     * The suffix on the end is a Base32 encoded 32-bit hash of random data plus
     * the version number of the jkta binary.  For example a scan kicked off in
     * parallel also at May 7, 2020 4:11 PM may look as follows:
     *
     *      scan-2020_05_07_16_11-reqsd6a-0.4.tsv.gz
     *
     * The S3 entry name is printed to the console output at the start of the scan.
     *
     * The use of a version number in the file name is intended to help identify
     * any scans that might need to be rerun due to updates in the scanning tool
     * as well as bring transparency to ensure the scanning tool is being updated.
     *
     * ENVIRONMENT
     *
     * Credentials to access the Amazon S3 bucket can be specified using the following
     * two environment variables.
     *
     *  - `JKTA_ACCESS_KEY` the AWS Access Key ID tied to the user in AWS AIM.  If unspecified
     *    the command will immediately terminate with status code 21.
     *
     *  - `JKTA_SECRET_KEY` the AWS Secret Access Key corresponding to the Access Key ID.  If
     *    unspecified the command will immediately terminate with status code 22.
     *
     * @param include A Java regular expression indicating which files should be
     *                scanned in the specified directory.  The --include is applied
     *                before the --exclude pattern allowing the include to serve
     *                as a course-grained select.
     * @param exclude A Java regular expression indicating which files should be
     *                excluded from the scan.  The --exclude is applied after the --include
     *                allowing the exclude to further refine any files matched.
     * @param bucket The AWS S3 bucket where the scan tsv.gz files will be uploaded
     * @param region The AWS region where the S3 bucket lives.  S3 bucket names
     *               are unique per region
     * @param repository The path to the local maven repository itself.  Used to ensure
     *                   only the path starting at the groupId is reported in the tsv.
     *                   Defaults to the current working directory.
